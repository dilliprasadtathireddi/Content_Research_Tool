CONTENT RESEARCH TOOL 📈🔎 (Ask questions about loaded research articles!)

This Streamlit app  gives you a platform to explore research articles and ask questions about their content

How it works:

•Add article URLs: Paste the URLs of the research articles you want to explore in the sidebar (up to 2 articles for now!)

•Process URLs: Click the button to process the articles. This involves:

•Downloading the articles
•Splitting the text into smaller chunks for analysis ✂️

•Creating embeddings to represent the meaning of the text

•Building an index to allow for fast retrieval ️ (This step might take a while ⏳)

•Ask your question: Once processing is complete, you can ask a question in the main text box ❓

•Get your answer: The app will use the processed articles to find relevant information and provide you with an answer
Additionally, it will highlight the sources it used to answer your question

*Note*:
*This is a work in progress, and the accuracy of the answers may vary.
Make sure you have the required libraries installed (streamlit, langchain, openai, etc.)*

Let's explore the world of research together!😊
